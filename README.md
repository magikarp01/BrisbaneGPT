# Brisbane (aka DirectoryGPT) -- A new way to interact with your filesystem.

If your files could talk, what would they say? Ask your old code to explain itself, your CS project to tell you its requirements, or a folder full of textbooks to summarize themselvesâ€”with Brisbane.

Brisbane is a file search engine that allows you to chat with your files using an interactive interface. Made for Bitcamp 2023 at UMD.
